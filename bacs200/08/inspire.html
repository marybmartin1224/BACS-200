            What makes a hero?  A hero is someone that we look up to.
            Heroes embody what we truly value most.  Therefore who we select as
            role models says a lot about who we are as people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Courageous</li>
            <li>Inspiring</li>
            <li>Respectable</li>
            <li>Worldly</li>
            <li>Honest</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Alex Morgan is a soccer player for the U.S. Women's National Team. Not only is she known for her outstanding athletic ability, she is also a great rolemodel for young women in modern society. She is an honest person who is involved in the world. Her tenacity and imbition is nontheless inspiring. It is uncommon for there to be a great of women leaders as her, and I love to continually watch her grow and evolve.
