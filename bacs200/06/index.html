            <li>In my educational YouTube video, I discuess the four major components to keep your skin safe during the spring and summer months. In most cases, skin aging and complications are due to external/environmental/environmental factors such as the sun.</li>
            <li>With that being said, using a good sunscree and reapplyin gthe sunscreen periodically throughout the day is crucial!  </li>
            <li>Alongside using a sufficent sunscreen, you must go to a dermatologist once a year for a skin check-up to ensure your skin and any moles or sunspots are normal. Lastly, everyone must STAY out of tanning beds, because they increase your chances of skin cancer by 75%!!  </li>
